## 🚀 Project Overview
This project provides an analysis and description of the stock market, including predictive modeling using machine learning. The goal is to understand market trends and forecast stock prices using historical data and technical indicators.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **💹 Analyze Historical Stock Data**  
   - Explore stock price trends over time and understand market movements.

2. **📊 Compare Machine Learning Models**  
   - Implement and evaluate an **XGBoost** model to forecast stock prices.

3. **🔍 Identify Patterns and Insights**  
   - Detect trends, anomalies, and potential investment opportunities.

4. **💹 Provide Visualizations and Reports**  
   - Create charts and summaries to understand market behavior effectively.
  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 📦 XGBoost, RandomForest, Decision Tree and ElasticNet for model training.
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA and visualization
- ⚙️ Scikit-learn for preprocessing, metrics, and pipelines
